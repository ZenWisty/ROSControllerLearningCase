1.This is a tutorial for ROS2 controller hardware interface development.
2.For convenient, the start dir contains a fundamental robot description, the end dir contains the whole project with a finished hardware interface job.
3.To figure out how to develop a HW interface, you may simply compare two project dir(start & end).
4.Here are some counterpart points marked down to notice the difference between  two projects, which you may pay attention to:
